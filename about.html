            <p class="about-margin-1 generic-text">I spend my free time playing Dungeons and Dragons,
                other board games, carrying teams in Dota 2, or hunting monsters in Hunt: Showdown, my latest
                obsession (and timesink, yeesh). I also spend WAY too much time reading Warhammer lore off of the
                wiki, and I have watched the Star Wars and Lord of the Rings movies an unhealthy number of times.</p>
            <p class="about-margin-2 generic-text">When I'm not gaming, I love to travel. I studied Ancient Greek and Roman history
            in my undergrad at UCLA, and I've been to both Italy and Greece. I love exploring new cultures, trying
            new foods, seeing the marvels of other societies, and seeing how people live around the world.</p>

            <p class="about-margin-1 generic-text">When I'm not doing any of that stuff, I'm hanging out with my girl, going to the
            beach, going to music festivals so I can mosh, planning out my next tattoo, or watching the Office for the
                50000th time.</p>
            <p class="about-margin-2 generic-text">And finally, when I'm not wasting my time I like to run through courses on sites like
            freeCodeCamp, or expand my skills in other ways such as trying new software or looking ahead at what I
            want to be learning next.</p>
